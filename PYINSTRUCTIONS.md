Type the problem, and you may choose to join a discussion/feedback group, or call a service member. If you choose to go to a discussion post, a link will be generated to take you to the suggested group (not always 100% accurate), and if you chose to call a service member, you will be instructed to type a phone number, or email to communicate to a member (this information is kept 100% private). You will then be emailed/called by one of our service members. (if called, a text will be sent first to verify that you answer our member, instead of being mistook as a sales call)
